# ATO

Currently this repository contains 2 sub-projects. By the end I hope to be able to combine the 2 projects to create
ATO. The first project is based around passing around phone information (Texts and Contacts) while the second
focuses on comparing words to a data table (WordNet) to create a list of similarities and themes related to the 
words.

As stated I hope to be able to combine both projects in the end to produce an app that aim to sort through
texts automatically and sort them in fields defined by the user. There is still a lot of work left to do, but
the end result should be interesting in my opinion.

## Open data and API's used:

* WordNet 3.0 ; https://wordnet.princeton.edu
* JAWS (Java API for WordNet Searching) ; http://lyle.smu.edu/~tspell/jaws/index.html
